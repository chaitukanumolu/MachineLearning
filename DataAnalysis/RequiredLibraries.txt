1. Numpy: Is a short from of Numerical python.  And NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computation in python.
Advantages of NumPy:
a. Fast and efficient multidimentional array object ndarray
b. Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical
operations between arrays
c. Tools for reading and writing array-based data sets to disk
d. Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
e. Tools for integrating connecting C, C++, and Fortran code to Python
f. one of the primary purposes with regards to data analysis is it is used as the primary container for data to be 
passed between algorithms. 
g. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, such as C or Fortran, can operate on the data stored in a 
NumPy array without copying any data.


2. Pandas: Fundamental features offered by Pandas is DataFrame.
pandas combines the high performance array-computing features of NumPy with the
flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases (such
as SQL). It provides sophisticated indexing functionality to make it easy to reshape,
slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select subsets of data. pandas is the primary
tool that we will use in this book.

The pandas name itself is derived from panel data, an econometrics term for multidimensional
structured data sets, and Python data analysis itself.

3. matplotlib : matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other 2D data
visualizations.

4. IPython: 

5. SciPy
